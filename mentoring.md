# Mentoring

## Pre-submission Mentorship Program
The SRW offers students the opportunity to get advance feedback before submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the studentâ€™s work, not to critique it. Participation is optional but encouraged. Pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.
We especially encourage partipation from undergraduates, Masters students, and others who are new to research.

Students wishing to participate must submit the paper by __Feb 1 2022__ via e-mail to [naacl2022-srw@googlegroups.com](mailto:naacl2022-srw@googlegroups.com) by filling out the [following](https://forms.gle/kS3ErsCKpJbqnjm77) form.

Note that even though the mentoring is not done anonymously, the paper needs to be anonymized. We will check the formatting of each paper before we match mentors.

Participants will receive a mentor who will review and provide feedback to the student within four weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission.
The feedback will be in the format of guidance and suggestions to improve the overall writing and communication of the paper; students are not required to make the changes suggested by the pre-submission mentor.


<!-- ## Mentoring of Accepted Papers

There will also be mentors who provide feedback to students in the form of in-depth comments and questions for the workshop presentation. -->
