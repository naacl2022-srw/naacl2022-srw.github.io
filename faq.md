#### Q: What size should my in-person poster be, and how do I get it printed?

#### Q: Can I submit my non-archival accepted paper in other venues?
__A:__ Yes.

#### Q: In case the student author is unable to attend due to university examinations, is it possible for the equally contributing other author to apply for the travel grant? 
__A:__ Yes.

#### Q: Can I submit supplemental materials?
__A:__ **Answer updated for 2022.** Supplementaty materials are permitted, but your paper should stand alone without requiring reading of them. Supplemental code and data should be submitted on OpenReview. Appendices should be appended starting on a new page after the References section in your main paper PDF.

#### Q: Where should I submit for pre-submission mentoring?
__A:__ You may e-mail __naacl2022-srw@googlegroups.com__ with the follow information:

#### Q: Double submission: where should it be mentioned that the paper will be submitted to other conference for reviewing?
__A:__ Double submission to the NAACL SRW and the main NAACL conference / other NAACL workshops is prohibited.
 
#### Q: If accepted, can a paper be published in the proceedings, even if it the student cannot take part at the workshop?
__A:__ The NAACL organizing team will attempt to provide travel grants to authors of all accepted papers. However, if things still don't work out, we can discuss remote presentation options should your paper be accepted.
 
#### Q: If the student is graduating before the mentoring/submission deadline, can they still submit to SRW?
__A:__ If the bulk of the work was done when the author was a student, it is acceptable to submit to SRW.
 
#### Q: If an author is to submit to the SRW in the non-archival tract, is it possible to resubmit to the main track of this year's ACL?
__A:__ The spirit of the SRW is to give you feedback to improve your work. If you submit to the mentoring deadline, the mentoring will prove useful. Otherwise, two days isn't much time to incorporate feedback for an ACL submission, so this goes against the spirit of the rule but is technically allowed. 

#### Q: What are the guidelines for the Camera-ready version?
__A:__ Camera ready FAQs are available [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-pub/blob/gh-pages/camera-ready-faq.md).
