# Travel and Grants
For students who are authors of papers accepted to the NAACL SRW, please fill out the form [here](https://forms.gle/uEHKFYZSEqHJYbqNA) to request a grant to offset some portion of your conference registration, travel, and accommodation expenses. **The deadline for applying for an SRW grant is June 1.** 
We will be prioritizing funding students who have accepted papers, are attending their first conference, and demonstrate financial need.

If you are an author of a paper accepted to the NAACL SRW, you **do not** need to fill out the NAACL D&I Subsidy and Volunteer form. Please use the form linked above instead.

If you are a student and you are not an author of a paper accepted to the NAACL SRW, you should fill out the [NAACL D&I Subsidy and Volunteer form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAO__UAd5zRUN1NBTjlZVlRYOFE0U0g2TkVKQVJLVjRTSS4u) BY MAY 24 to request funding to attend the conference.
